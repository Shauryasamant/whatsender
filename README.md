# whatsender
WhatSender is a python package that allows you to send Whatsapp messages at a given time.


HOW TO USE

```python
from WhatSender import SendMessage

# syntax => SendMessage(number, message, timeToSend, spam, download)

SendMessage("+15134123", "Hello World", "19:02", spam=False, download=True)
```

PAY ATTENTION! <3

*You only need to set download to be true on the first run of the package,<br>
 Keeping it on won't make the app crush but it will cost more of the computer resources.
